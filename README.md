# Why

Because my processors (AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 7950X3D) heats up if the game are using the wrong cores.

# How does it work

Just like you would do using the task manager, it selects all the cores of the CCX without 3D V-Cache.  
Just avoiding repetitive tasks hehe

# How to use

Just start the executable after Far Cry 5 opens.
